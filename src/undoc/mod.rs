//! This module mirrors the other modules, except that the source code here is uncommented,
//! so it can be easily copy pasted into your solution without having huge code blocks.
//!
//! There are also some templates in this module with stuff frequently used or tools used.
//! The most basic one is [main], which offers a framework of running samples and has
//! [InParser] and [OutParser] already pasted.
